# Driver Booking App — Project Status Report
**Checkpoint:** 2025-09-12 (post migrations & API tests)

## Environment
- Laravel 12.x, PHP 8.2
- MySQL 8 (Hostinger shared)
- Root: /home/u608956572/domains/wow.dukandar.online/public_html/wow
- APP_DEBUG=true (development)

## What we completed (today)
- Fixed Bookings table schema: added columns `driver_id`, `pickup`, `dropoff`, `amount`.
- Expanded `status` enum to accept controller values.
- Made `booking_code` NOT NULL and populated NULL rows with unique UUID codes.
- Model update: `app/Models/Booking.php` replaced to auto-generate `booking_code`, add casts and relations (customer, driver).
- Created migration `2025_09_12_200000_update_bookings_table.php` and ran `php artisan migrate --force`.
- Verified Bookings CRUD via API:
  - Create → HTTP 201 (ids 1,2,3 created during tests)
  - List → HTTP 200 (records visible)
  - Update → HTTP 200 (status change to accepted)
  - Delete → HTTP 200 (record deleted)
- Admin login & token tested; admin password was reset temporarily for testing.

## Current status (stable)
- Auth ✅ (Sanctum tokens)
- Users CRUD ✅
- Drivers CRUD ✅
- Bookings CRUD ✅ (schema aligned with controller and model)
- booking_code generation ✅ (model-level, and existing rows migrated)

## Next recommended tasks (priority)
1. Add server-side generation of `booking_code` in controller as fallback (already in model, but helpful for batch imports).
2. Add validation rules and tighten request validation for bookings (phone, vehicle, status allowed list).
3. Implement soft deletes for bookings/drivers if required by business logic.
4. Add event logs/notifications on status changes (requested/confirmed/completed).
5. Prepare deployment checklist:
   - Set APP_DEBUG=false
   - Run composer install & optimize on deploy
   - Consider moving to VPS for production
6. Add an artisan command or scheduled job to ensure booking_code uniqueness and to backfill any future anomalies.

## Notes & Risks
- Some raw `ALTER TABLE` statements used directly; on stricter DB hosts these may need to be adjusted into safe migrations.
- We made `booking_code` NOT NULL and used UUIDs — ensures uniqueness but changes legacy format.
- Keep a DB backup before making schema changes on production.
